I am a PhD student in the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at National University of Singapore ([NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg/)), advised by Prof. [Bryan Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/) and Prof. [See-Kiong Ng](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ngsk/). My current research is on **Machine Unlearning** and **Data Attribution** in **Large Language Models**.
